Description: 
    The eCV package provides extensions and alternative methods to measure the
    reproducibility  of  omic  data  with  an  arbitrary  number of replicates.
    It introduces an enhanced Coefficient of Variation  (eCV)  metric to assess
    the likelihood of omic features being reproducible. Additionally, it offers
    alternatives  to  the  Irreproducible  Discovery  Rate  (IDR)  calculations
    for multi-replicate experiments.  These  tools  are  valuable for analyzing
    high-throughput data in genomics and other omics fields <doi:10.1101/2023.12.18.572208>.
